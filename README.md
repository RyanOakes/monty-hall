#Monty Hall Experiment


##Background Info


The eponymous gameshow host, Monty Hall, tempts contestants with a big prize, hidden behind one of three doors. The contestant begins by choosing a door but not opening it. Then, Monty steps forward and opens one of the other doors. He reveals a goat (!). Then the contestant has the choice of either sticking with the door they have already chosen, or switching to the other unopened door. Whichever door the contestant decides on will be opened, and if they find the prize, they get to keep it. I’m not sure what happens if they get the second goat!


People are biased towards sticking with what they’ve chosen, and the vast majority of people keep the door they originally picked. Intuitively, there should be an equal chance of the prize being behind any of the three doors, so it shouldn’t matter if you stick or switch. However, in this case, your intuition is wrong. You are twice as likely to win the prize if you switch to the other unopened door.

I was not the only one to disbelieve this result, apparently even famous mathematicians have refused to accept it. What finally convinced them, was a computer simulation.


##Objectives

Understand randomness
Understand the Monty Hall problem
Be able to use the Python random module
Be able to use randomness to perform a simulation

###Primary Task
Your task is to write that computer simulation. Prove that switching doors is best, by simulating 1000 games using each strategy and comparing the winning percentage.
